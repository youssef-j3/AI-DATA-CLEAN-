 AI Project Assignment Proposal  
Title: Predictive Analysis of Public Transportation Delays Using a Dirty Real -World 
Dataset  
1. Project Overview  
Public transportation systems generate large amounts of operational data, often 
recorded under real -world constraints that lead to errors, missing values, noise, and 
inconsistencies. In this project, students will work with a deliberately “dirty” dataset  
representing bus schedule information. The dataset contains:  
• Missing timestamps  
• Inconsistent time formats  
• Incorrect GPS points  
• Categorical noise (e.g., “sunny,” “SUN,” “clody”)  
• Outliers in passenger counts  
• Mixed route ID formats  
Students are expected to clean, preprocess, analyze, and model this dataset using AI 
and machine learning techniques. This assignment reinforces key concepts from the 
Introduction to AI course, such as data processing, feature engineering, predictive 
model ing, and model evaluation.  
2. Objective  
The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI -based predictive system for 
estimating bus delay behavior  using imperfect real -world data.  
Students will:  
1. Perform comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Engineer meaningful features from the cleaned data  
4. Build and evaluate predictive ML models  
5. Interpret results using explainability tools  
6. Present findings in an academic -style report

 3. Dataset Description  
Students will use the provided dataset:  
dirty_transport_dataset.csv  
(Contains ~300 bus trip records)  
Dataset Attributes  
Column Name  Description  
route_id  Noisy categorical bus route identifiers  
scheduled_time  Scheduled arrival time (clean format)  
actual_time  Actual arrival time (multiple inconsistent formats; missing values)  
weather  Noisy weather condition (misspellings, case differences)  
passenger_count  Passenger count with outliers and missing values  
latitude  GPS latitude, includes impossible coordinates (e.g., 999)  
longitude  GPS longitude, includes missing values  
“Dirty” Characteristics Students Must Fix  
• Missing actual arrival times  
• Time format inconsistencies (e.g., "12:45", "12.45PM", "1245")  
• Noisy weather labels (“clody”, “CLOUDY”, “sunny”)  
• Incorrect passenger values (0, >200, negative numbers)  
• GPS errors (impossible coordinates, null values)  
• Mixed route identifiers such as “R1”, “3”, “Route -4” 
This dataset is intentionally unclean to ensure students practice real data preparation 
skills, not just model training.  
4. Methodology Requirements  
Students must follow a structured and fully documented pipeline:  
4.1 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
Required tasks:  
1. Missing Data Treatment  
3 
 o Choose appropriate imputation strategies for time, weather, and 
passenger count  
o Justify your choices  
2. Standardization & Formatting  
o Convert all timestamps into consistent ISO format (YYYY -MM -DD 
HH:MM:SS)  
o Normalize weather labels (lowercase, corrected spelling)  
o Create a unified route ID format  
3. Outlier Detection  
o Use IQR or Z -score to detect extreme passenger counts and delay 
values  
o Decide which outliers to keep, fix, or remove with justification  
4. GPS Validation  
o Identify impossible lat/long values  
o Decide whether to remove or replace those records  
5. Feature Engineering  
Students should at minimum create:  
o Delay duration in minutes (scheduled vs. actual)  
o Time -of-day category (morning/afternoon/evening)  
o Day type (weekday vs weekend)  
o Weather severity index (light/moderate/heavy)  
o Route frequency features  
4.2 AI/ML Modeling  
Students must test at least two ML models , such as:  
• Linear Regression  
• Random Forest Regression  
• XGBoost / Gradient Boosting  
• kNN Regression  
 
4 
 4.3 Explainability Techniques  
Students must include:  
• SHAP values or feature importance  
• Discussion of key features impacting prediction  
5. Expected Challenges & Limitations  
Students must reflect on:  
• Bias introduced during imputation  
• Correlations between time -related features  
• Noise affecting model stability  
• Weather inconsistencies  
• Possible overfitting in high -complexity models  
• GPS errors limiting spatial analysis  
This reflection should be included in the report.  
6. Timeline & Deliverables  
3 weeks  
Required Deliverables  
Students must submit:  
1. Cleaned dataset  
2. Python Jupyter Notebook  (well -structured and commented)  
3. Final written report (8 –12 pages)  
4. Slide presentation  
5. Model evaluation summary  
6. Interpretability results  
7. Evaluation Criteria  
Model Performance Metrics  
Students must evaluate models using:  
• MAE  (Mean Absolute Error)  
• RMSE  (Root Mean Squared Error)  
5 
 • MSE  (Mean Squared Error)  
• R² Score  
• Cross -validation scores  
Grading Breakdown  
Component  Weight  
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  25%  
EDA & Feature Engineering  20%  
Model Development  20%  
Model Evaluation  15%  
Explainability & Interpretation  10%  
Final Report & Presentation  10%  
8. Final Notes for Students  
This project emphasizes hands -on real -world AI work  rather than theoretical 
exercises.  
Students are expected to justify every step, make data -driven decisions, and 
demonstrate critical thinking.  
Creativity in modeling and analysis is encouraged.
